AWKHelpers
===============

A growing collection of UIKit and Foundation categories (helpers) we use at Awkward

Current helpers:
- UIApplication
- NSArray
  - Queue
- UIColor
- NSDate*
- UIDevice
- NSDictionary
- UIFont
- NSString

*The AWKDateHelper is still in development and might not give the wanted results.
